Expose to localhost only? [yes] $[type]

Sandstorm supports 'dev accounts', a feature that lets anyone log in
as admin and other sample users to a Sandstorm server. We recommend
it for app development, and absolutely do not recommend it for
a server on the public Internet.
Enable dev accounts? [yes] $[type]
Server main HTTP port: [6080] $[type]
Database port (choose any unused port): [6081]$[type]
URL users will enter in browser: [http://localhost:6080]$[type]
Sandstorm requires you to set up a wildcard DNS entry pointing at the server.
This allows Sandstorm to allocate new hosts on-the-fly for sandboxing purposes.
Please enter a DNS hostname containing a '*' which maps to your server. For
example, if you have mapped *.foo.example.com to your server, you could enter
"*.foo.example.com". You can also specify that hosts should have a special
prefix, like "ss-*.foo.example.com". Note that if your server's main page
is served over SSL, the wildcard address must support SSL as well, which
implies that you must have a wildcard certificate. If you are serving off
a non-standard port, you must include it here as well.
Wildcard host: [*.localhost:6080]$[type]
