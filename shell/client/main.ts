// NOTES
// =====
//
// This file exists to reify load order as we try to move everything to modern
// explicit imports.  We'll start by moving files under /imports/ and then
// importing them in the same order that Meteor would have.  This gives us the
// ability to start explicitly importing and exporting variables that we
// currently just rely on being present in the namespace at the right time.
//
// To allow incremental migration, this file's path is explicitly chosen to be
// the very first thing that is loaded out of the application client-side.  We
// can shuffle things around and refactor a lot more easily once we've
// crashlanded everything in /imports/.  Eventually, there will be a single file
// under client/ that imports everything in the order Meteor would have.
//
// Eventually, we'll also move packages in here, above the app's primary
// implementation, since packages are loaded first
//
// For more information on Meteor's load order, see
// https://guide.meteor.com/structure.html#load-order
