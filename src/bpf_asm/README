This directory contains the bpf assembler included in the linux kernel
source tree in `tools/bpf`. Unfortunately that command line tool
is not generally available as a stand-alone tool, so we've extracted it
for our own use here, and integrated it with ekam.

This was copied from the cloudflare bpftools repo:

    https://github.com/cloudflare/bpftools

...which moves some things around to get the tool to build outside of
the kernel source tree. That version was in turn copied from
linux/tools/net:

    https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/tools/net

(Note that tools/net has since been renamed to tools/bpf).

This directory is released under the GPLv2 license, though note
that this is only used during the build process, and does not end up in
a shipped sandstorm bundle, so Sandstorm itself remains available
under the Apache 2.0 license.
